## README.md

This folder includes the code necessary to produce supplementary figure5.

The following files are included: 

- [SuppFig-AsymmetricCase_R1.R](SuppFig-AsymmetricCase_R1.R). This R script produce the figure using the results in the folder simResults.
- [SuppFig_Assym_Arc_n50.pdf](SuppFig_Assym_Arc_n50.pdf). This is the figure.
- [suppFig-functions.R](suppFig-functions.R) This Rscript contains all the function needed by *SuppFig-AsymmetricCase_R1.R* to generate the figure. It also includes the functions that generate the symetric and asymetric results in *simResults/*. The code to create these files is commented out from line 606-616.
- [simResults](simResults)
