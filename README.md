# genetic_trade_offs_simulations
This repository contains the code necessary to replicate the simulations in Connallon et al. : Predicting the prevalence of genetic trade-offs among adaptive substitutions.

The following files are included:
  - [fixSA.netbenefit.R](fixSA.netbenefit.R) .This file defines a function that runs the Wright-Fisher distribution of fitness effects with sexes
  - This file runs the simulations an produces the visualisation included in the manuscript.
